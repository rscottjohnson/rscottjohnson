### Hi, I'm Scott ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently completed my [Master of Science in Software Engineering at East Carolina University](https://cet.ecu.edu/csci/graduate-programs/ms-in-software-engineering/) which I decided to pursue after completing the [Coding Bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill](https://bootcamp.unc.edu/coding/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on a project (or projects) where I can grow both my experience and knowledge.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m interested in learning how to contribute to open source projects.
