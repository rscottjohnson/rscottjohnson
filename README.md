### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [Master of Science in Software Engineering at East Carolina University](https://cet.ecu.edu/csci/graduate-programs/ms-in-software-engineering/) (May '21).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [C#](https://www.packtpub.com/mobile/c-8-0-and-net-core-3-0-modern-cross-platform-development-fourth-edition) (for work), as well as [Vue.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/vuejs-2-web-development-projects) and [Ruby](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) (on my own time).
